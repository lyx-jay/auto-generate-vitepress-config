# auto-generate-vitepress-config

## What is it ?

Usually, if we want to add an article on vitepress, we have to go through the following two steps:

1. write a new post
2. add relative config in .vitepress/config.js

One post is ok. However, if we write a lot of articles at onceï¼Œdo we need to add configuration information one by one?

That's too terrible.

auto-generate-vitepress-config can help you automaticlly generate right configuration.

All you need to do is write posts.
